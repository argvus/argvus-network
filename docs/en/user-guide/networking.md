description: Manage NetworkManager and Bluetooth through ARGVUS.
---

`argvus-network` provides `argvus-networkctl` for NetworkManager and `argvus-bluetoothctl` for Bluetooth adapter state and availability. The Control Panel and Waybar call these helpers.

Use `--help` on either command for the installed subcommands. Network and Bluetooth UI integration is separate from optional advanced managers such as Blueman.

The Control Center separates network status from configuration pages: **Network → Status** summarizes the current state, while interfaces, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN, DNS, proxy and firewall are separate routes when their providers are available. **Bluetooth → State**, **Devices** and **Pair** cover adapter state and device actions. These pages perform provider-backed system actions; the taskbar and Control Panel expose the quick status/action surface.

Network and Bluetooth changes may require authorization and may apply immediately through NetworkManager or the Bluetooth service. They are not the same as changing the ARGVUS taskbar indicator.

## Command-line network management

Use `argvus-networkctl` to query and control networking without the graphical interface:

```sh
# Show network status
argvus-networkctl status

# Toggle networking on/off
argvus-networkctl enable
argvus-networkctl disable

# Wi-Fi control
argvus-networkctl wifi on
argvus-networkctl wifi off

# Open connection manager
argvus-networkctl connection-manager
```

## Command-line Bluetooth management

Use `argvus-bluetoothctl` for Bluetooth device and adapter control:

```sh
# Show Bluetooth adapter state
argvus-bluetoothctl status

# Toggle Bluetooth on/off
argvus-bluetoothctl enable
argvus-bluetoothctl disable

# List paired devices
argvus-bluetoothctl list

# Connect/disconnect devices
argvus-bluetoothctl connect <device-name-or-address>
argvus-bluetoothctl disconnect <device-name-or-address>

# Trust or untrust a device
argvus-bluetoothctl trust <device-address>
argvus-bluetoothctl untrust <device-address>
```

Use `--help` on either command to see additional options and subcommands specific to your installed version.
